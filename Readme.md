# Computer Graphics Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various computer graphics algorithms. You can compile and run the code on both Linux and Windows (WSL2) environments. 

## Tools Required

- **Operating System**: Linux / Windows (WSL2)
- **Software**: [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Herogo3241/computer-graphics.git
   cd computer-graphics
   ```

2. **Install ImageMagick**  
   To install ImageMagick, follow the steps for your operating system:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install imagemagick
   ```

## Compilation

Once the repository is cloned and dependencies are installed, you can compile the code using the following command:

```bash
gcc main.c <path-to-pixel.c> [-o <executable name>]
```

After compiling the code, you can run the resulting executable to test the implemented algorithms.


The program will run and execute the computer graphics algorithms.
